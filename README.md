- Open the project folder in a terminal:

        npm install              # fetches dependencies
        npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

## Description

Example on creating a Custom Color Theme for a simple ChartXY.

This does not contain a complete color theme, only the properties which are present in this particular chart application are specified for simplicity.

The Custom theme is created by overriding select properties of a default theme, the `lightNew` Theme specifically.

Custom themes are a good option to styling each component at a time, especially as custom themes can be much more easily shared between different charts or applications.
